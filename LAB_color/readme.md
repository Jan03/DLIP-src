# LAB: Color Image Segmentation 
### Detect Face Temperature from IR(Infra-Red) images

## I. Introduction
In this lab, you are required to create a simple program that detects the temperature of a person wearing a mask. You will be given a video of IR images of several people measuring their face temperature. Measure the maximum and average temperature of the face (excluding the mask) and show a warning sign if the average temperature is above 38.0 C.
We will not use any deep learning or any other complex algorithms. Just use simple image processing methods such as :  
*	InRange, Morphology, Filtering, findContour
*	Refer to [Tutorial: Color Image Segmentation] for programming tips
