# Tutorial: Edge, StraightLine, Circle Detection

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use OpenCV to detect edges, lines and circles. For an application, you will learn how to find straight lanes using Canny edge detection and Hough transformation algorithms.  

* Edge Detection
* Hough transformation for Line, Circle Detection
